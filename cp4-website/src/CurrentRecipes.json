(A bag and rolling pin works just as well!) Then take your processed oreos, oreo cream, butter, and powder sugar and mix them all into a seperate bowl. Mix until the mixture develops into a dough-like consistency. Once you have your dough, roll up the mixture into several balls. Stick a toothpick into the balls and place in the freezer for about 30 minutes. Once the 30 minutes is up, grab your white chocolate and either microwave for 10 second intervals until the chocolate is smooth. Or take your chocolate and temper it over boiling water. Once the chocolate is ready, dip your oreo balls into the chocolate mix and leave to dry on a parchment paper. Wait until the chocolate is harden before serving. If you want to make your oreo balls look even more professional, wait until the chocolate is dry. Remove the tooth pick and melt some milk chocolate and place it into an icing bag. Create a few chocolate drizzles over the balls to give it a nice little finish.  ",
